Spot machines are highly affordable, short lived machines. They can be terminated at any time and run for a maximum of 24 hours. If your Workspace or Job is running and a Spot machine is in use, we will automatically pause your workspace and notify you.

## Select Spot on creation
When creating a Workspace or Job, check the box next to **Use spot machine**.
