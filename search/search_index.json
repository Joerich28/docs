The idea is simple, annotate once then QC each successive dataset after. Once you have annotated enough data, you can train a model to pre-annotate the rest of your images with a few button clicks. Training Object Detection Model Through CVAT \u00b6 1 - Annotate enough images in your CVAT task. 2 - Go back to your CVAT dashboard and click on Create New Annotation Model in that task. You will see a popup with a few options. 3 - Select the appropriate model type (TensorFlow OD API recommended) and then select the model (i.e ssd-mobilenet-v2-coco-201). 4 - Select the machine type. A machine with multiple GPUs will speed up your training process. 5 - Enter optional arguments. See below for more details. 6 - Click on link to new model in email that will be sent to you once model training completes - locate the tf_annoation_model folder and inspect the contents. 7 - Mount this new dataset to the CVAT workspace and click the button for the Model manager. Then select files in tf_annotation_model folder. 8 - Click TF_Annotion button for the current task. Live Demo: https://c.onepanel.io/onepanel-demo/projects/cvat-public-demo/overview Arguments (optional) \u00b6 You can optionally specify some arguments in the Arguments field seperated by ; . Here is a sample: epochs=100;batch_size=24 . epochs : number of epochs to train your model for. By default, we will train for an appropriate number of epochs depending upon the model. batch_size : batch size for the training initial_learning_rate : initial learning rate for the model. We recommend you do not change this. num_clones (default=1): number of GPUs to train the model If you select a Machine type with 4 GPUs (Tesla V100), the following command can be used: epochs=300000;num_clones=4 Note that num_clones is 4 because there are 4 GPUs available. Choosing the right base model \u00b6 You can use any of the models that we support to train your custom pre-annotation models. Here, we provide a brief explanation on how to choose one model over another based on your needs. Some models are faster than others, whereas some are more accurate than others. We hope this information will help you choose the right model for your task. Note that we don't support Yolo and MaskRCNN models yet. We currently support a few faster-rcnn models. All of these models are similar except that of the backbone used for the feature extraction. The backbones used are, in increasing order of complexity (i.e more layers), ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionResNetV2. As the model complexity increases the computation requirement will also increase. If you have very complicated data (i.e hundreds of annotations in one image), then it is recommended that you choose complex model (i.e InceptionResNetV2). Faster-rcnn models are generally more accurate than ssd models. However, sometimes you are better off using ssd models if your data is easy to learn (i.e 1 or 2 bounding box per image). frcnn-inc-resv2-atr-coco: \u00b6 This is a type of faster-rcnn model with InceptionResNetV2 backbone. If you are not sure about which model to use then we recommend you use SSD based model (i.e ssd-mobilenet-v2). Depending upon your data, you can set epochs to train your model. There is no standard value which can work for all datasets. You generally have to try different number of epochs to get the best model. Ideally, you do so by monitoring loss of your model while training. But if you are looking for a recommendation. Then, we recommend you set epochs as follows: (number of images / batch_size (default: 1)) * 500. For instance, if you have 100 images, then your epochs will be 50000(rounded). Please note that the model will be trained using a pre-trained model, so you don't need to train as long as you would have to when not using the pre-trained model. Please note that current implementation of faster-rcnn inTensorFlow Object Detection API does not support batch training. That is, you shouldn't change batch_size.

A machine with 1 GPU will throw an error. This is a type of faster-rcnn model with NAS backbone. If you are not sure about which model to use then we recommend you use SSD based model (i.e ssd-mobilenet-v2). For how to set epochs, you can take a look at first model since both models are faster-rcnn based.

If you are not sure about which model to use then we recommend you use SSD based model (i.e ssd-mobilenet-v2). If you are looking for more complex and accurate model then check out frcnn-res101-coco or frcnn-inc-resv2-atr-coco.

However, they are not as accurate as faster-rcnn based models. This model is generally recommended since its accurate and fast enough. If you don't know much about your data or the complexity of your data, then we recommend you go with this model. You will find the pre-trained model and config file for ssd-mobilenetv2 model trained on COCO dataset. This model is a good place to start if you don't have any specific model in mind. If you are data is very complicated (i.e many annotations per image) then you should prefer faster-rcnn models over ssd. Depending upon your data, you can set epochs to train your model. There is no standard value which can work for all datasets. You generally have to try different number of epochs to get the best model.

Parameters : Even though you don't need to enter any parameters to start the training of Mask-RCNN, it is recommended that you pass correct epochs according your data. Mask-RCNN is a very deep model which takes too much time to train and also to get enough accuracy. We allow you to set epochs for three different parts of the model. These parts are called stage1 , stage2 and stage3 . You can set corresponding epochs through --stage1_epochs , --stage2_epochs , and --stage3_epochs . If you have few images (few hundreds), then we recommend you set total epochs (stage1+stage2+stage3) less than 10. We advise you set more epochs for stage1 than others. As your data size increases or the complexity of your data increases you might want to increase epochs. If you have ~1000 images then you don't have to set any parameters, CVAT will take care of it. Adding your own base model to CVAT \u00b6 You can also add your own base models to CVAT via Onepanel. Please email us at info@onepanel.io to learn how.

You will find a Create New Task button on top, clicking on it will open up a new pop up window as follows: Now, you give this task a name you like. Then, labels that you are interested in annotating (i.e car, bicycle). You also need to select the source of your data (images). You can upload from your local machine or use data uploaded to Onepanel dataset. In the later case, you need to select the Share option. Now, go ahead and click on Select files. If you selected Share, then your dataset will be inside /input/datasets/ . After you select the images, hit submit to create a new task. Manual Annotation \u00b6 Once you have created a new task, you can start annotating your data. CVAT supports points, box, polylines, polygons for annotation. So, the first thing you should do is go to bottom-left of the window and select the type of annotation you want as shown below. Points \u00b6 If you want to annotate points, then select Points instead of Box which is a default choice. Once you select points, you can start annotating by clicking on Create Shape, clicking on image where you want to put the point and then click on stop shape. Or alternatively you can use keyboard shortcut N instead of Create Shape/Stop Shape. Make sure you periodically save your annotation by pressing ctrl + s. Bounding Box \u00b6 The same process follows for bounding boxes. Select Box and press N to start annotating once done, press N to finish annotation. If you want to change the class of an object. Finish drawing bounding box around an object, then go to right sidebar and change the class from a dropdown menu. The same has been heighted in blue color in above picture. Polygons \u00b6 Similarly, select polygons or polylines and follow same procedure for annotation. Semi-automatic Annotation of Polygon \u00b6 We also support a specific type of pre-annotation called Extreme Points to Segmentation. In this case, you don\u2019t need to select complete boundary of an object. Instead, you just put some points (i.e 4) around an object then hit N. It will find perfect boundary automatically. For this to work, you need to select Auto Segmentation from the bottom left option. Using Pre-Annotation Model \u00b6 Onepanel\u2019s CVAT supports a feature to pre-annotate images for common objects. In order to use any pre-annotation feature, you first need to upload the model. By default, we provide a default model for bounding box annotation. Click on Model Manager, and give a name to it. Click on select files -> input -> models -> cvat-default and select both files. Hit submit to upload the model. For segmentation model, you first need to attach the default to your workspace. For this, click on your workspace name on top, you will find an option to Add Dataset. Then, search for maskrcnn-default, click on Add. Now, go to Model Manager and upload this model, but make sure you select Segmentation instead of TF Annotation in radio button. Also, you can found model in input - > dataset -> onepanel-demo -> maskrcnn-default. Select both files. Above image shows how you can attach dataset to the workspace. Below image shows how you can upload your models to model manager. Once you have the models in Model manager. Click on Run TF Annotation or Run Auto Segmentation depending upon your need. Then, you will be asked to select the model you want to use for pre-annotation. You can also control the class mapping from your task\u2019s classes to model\u2019s classes. Once done, click on start to start pre-annotation. Once it's done, you can click on the task link to access the annotation. Training New Annotation Model \u00b6 Onepanel also allows you to further finetune your model for annotation. Once you are done with your annotation or adjustment to pre-annotation, you can train a new model on it. To do so, go to dashboard -> Create Annotation Model. There, you can select the Tensorflow OD API for bounding boxes or Mask RCNN for segmentation. For TensorFlow OD API, we support multiple models. In fact, its dynamic. You can also train the model you like as long as it is supported by Tensorflow Object Detection API. How to choose the model: \u00b6 If you are unsure about which model to use, we usually suggest ssd-mobilenet-v2 since ssd-based models are faster and accurate enough for most of the work. Faster-rcnn (frcnn) models are more accurate in general but they will be relatively slow during training as well inference. If accuracy is more important to you, we suggest you go with frcnn-res101-coco model.","title":"Quick Quide on CVAT"},{"location":"CVAT/quick_guide/#quick-guide-on-using-cvat","text":"","title":"Quick Guide on Using CVAT"},{"location":"CVAT/quick_guide/#creating-new-tasks","text":"Once you're inside CVAT dashboard, you can create new tasks to start annotating.

Faster-rcnn (frcnn) models are more accurate in general but they will be relatively slow during training as well inference. If accuracy is more important to you, we suggest you go with frcnn-res101-coco model.","title":"How to choose the model:"},{"location":"CVAT/semiautomatic_annotation/","text":"Semi-automatic Annotation on CVAT \u00b6 You can use your TensorFlow or OpenVINO model to pre-annotate your data. This can save you a lot of time since you don't have to annotate images from scratch. On Onepanel, you can leverage these features to pre-annotate your bounding boxes or polygon masks. You can also use Object Tracking to track objects in a sequence of frames. Uploading Your Model on CVAT \u00b6 Before using any type of semi-automatic annotation, you will need to upload your model on CVAT Model Manager. To upload your model, go to your CVAT dashboard and click on Model Manager. A pop window will appear where you can give a name to your model, select the source of your files (local or onepanel datasets), and select files. For TF Annotation and Segmentation, you will need two files- model and classes.csv. For TF Annotation, the model should be Tensorflow Frozen Graph (.pb). For Segmentation, it should be keras model (.h5). Semi-automatic Annotation of Bounding Boxes \u00b6 The first step is to upload your model on CVAT or use our default model which is inside input/models/cvat-default. Now, click on Run TF Annotation. A pop up will appear where you can select the model you want to use for pre-annotation. Once you select the model, an automatic class mapping will appear, you can modify it if you want. Once done, click on Start. Once it is done, you can go into your task and check out the pre-annotation. Semi-automatic Annotation of Polygon Masks (Segmentation) \u00b6 On your CVAT dashboard, go to a task where you would like to run this pre-annotation model on, find Run Auto Segmentation button and click on it. Similar to above, a list of models will appear. Select the model and hit Start. Your pre-annotation will be started. Please note that the Mask RCNN model is a compute intensive model. It would require at least a single GPU machine. Hardware Requirement \u00b6 For training a model(Create New Annotation Model), you can choose any GPU machine from the list. All of our models will work on any of the GPU machine. But if you want to train it faster, then we suggest you select machines with multiple GPUs (i.e 8 V100). For pre-annotation, you can use CPU machine (32gb only) for TF Annotation (bounding box). But It will be considerably slow. So, we suggest you choose a GPU machine for pre-annotation. For pre-annotation of polygons, you have to use a GPU machine since the Mask RCNN model is compute-intensive. Please find below a table which enlists machine type with corresponding runtime to run pre-annotation. For this test, we used a task with 3550 images (2GB) to run pre-annotation on. Machine Time K80 160 minutes V100 80 minutes V100 x 4 21 minutes Run time depends upon factors such as model, number of images, type of machine. The above data was generated for ssd-mobilenet-v2 model which is the model we suggest to use in normal circumstances. If you have complex annotation and want to use faster-rcnn based model, then it might take slightly more time. But note that it won\u2019t significantly alter the data presented above. The other factor is image compression. By default, CVAT compresses images by 50%. We did some testing to find out if we use original images (without compression) then how much time it will take. It turns out if you use original images without compression, then your pre-annotation time will be increased by ~5-6% of that of 50% compressed images. So in above table, if you use images without compression and use V100, then it will take 84 minutes instead of 80 minutes. Please note that this compression does not affect annotation in any way. Note that this data was calculated on 3550 images (1280 x 960)(total size=2GB), so if your data size is different you can easily extrapolate information from above table. For example, if you have 10gb of images then ideally it will take around 400 minutes on V100. If the resolution of your images is slightly different, then it won\u2019t affect run time significantly. In fact, if the difference is ~200 pixels then it won\u2019t change at all, generally.

Holding onto your private information is a serious responsibility, and we want you to know how we're handling it. What information Onepanel collects and why Information from website browsers If you're just browsing the website, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not. The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor\u2019s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Why do we collect this? We collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use Onepanel, and to monitor and protect the security of the website. Information from users with accounts If you create an account, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email account. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include \"User Personal Information.\" \"User Personal Information\" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of \u201cUser Personal Information.\u201d User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service. Why do we collect this? We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request. We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you on Onepanel. We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to. We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you\u2019ve said that\u2019s okay. We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement. If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first. You can always see what information we have, how we're using it, and what permissions you have given us in your user profile. What information Onepanel does not collect We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Onepanel does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in a repository. If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, which are in the United States. We do not intentionally collect information that is stored in your repositories or other free-form content inputs. Information in your repositories belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service. Onepanel employees do not access private repositories unless required to for security or maintenance, or for support reasons, with the consent of the repository owner. If your repository is public, anyone (including us) may view its contents. If you have included private or sensitive information in your public repository, such as email addresses, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. In addition, while we do not generally search for content in your repositories, we may scan our servers for certain tokens or security signatures. If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on Onepanel. Onepanel does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account. We don't want to discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules. Please see our Terms of Service for information about account termination. How we share the information we collect We may sometimes share User Personal Information with third parties. We do not disclose User Personal Information outside Onepanel, except in the situations listed in this section or in the section below on Compelled Disclosure. We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use Onepanel, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events. For example, we may compile statistics on the usage of open source licenses across Onepanel. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers. We do not host advertising on Onepanel. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads. While we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded content contains, we can't always control what third parties show. We may share User Personal Information, so we can perform services you have requested. We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of third-party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Statement. Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and other similar services. When we transfer your data to our vendors under Privacy Shield, we remain responsible for it. We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Statement or in our Terms of Service. Public Information on Onepanel \u00b6 Much of Onepanel is public-facing. If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing Onepanel information. Your Personal Information, associated with your content, may be gathered by third parties in these compilations of Onepanel data. If you do not want your Personal Information to appear in third parties\u2019 compilations of Onepanel data, please do not make your Personal Information publicly available and be sure to configure your email address to be private in your user profile. If you would like to compile Onepanel data, you may only use any public-facing Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our user has authorized it. For example, where a Onepanel user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from Onepanel, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from Onepanel or Onepanel users. Similarly, projects on Onepanel may include publicly available Personal Information collected as part of the collaborative process. In the event that a Onepanel project contains publicly available Personal Information that does not belong to Onepanel users, we will only use that Personal Information for the limited purpose for which it was collected, and we will secure that Personal Information as we would secure any User Personal Information. If you have a complaint about any Personal Information on Onepanel, please see our section on resolving complaints. Our use of cookies and tracking Cookies Onepanel uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of Onepanel. A cookie is a small piece of text that our web server stores on your computer or mobile device, which your browser sends to us when you return to our site. Cookies do not necessarily identify you if you are merely visiting Onepanel; however, a cookie may store a unique identifier for each logged in user. The cookies Onepanel sets are essential for the operation of the website, or are used for performance or functionality. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device\u2019s ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use Onepanel\u2019s services. Google Analytics We use Google Analytics as a third party tracking service, but we don\u2019t use it to track you individually or collect your User Personal Information. We use Google Analytics to collect information about how our website performs and how our users, in general, navigate through and use Onepanel. This helps us evaluate our users' use of Onepanel; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance. Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about your use of Onepanel. We do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your user name. Onepanel will not, nor will we allow any third party to, use the Google Analytics tool to track our users individually; collect any User Personal Information other than IP address; or correlate your IP address with your identity. Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers a browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking. Certain pages on our site may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we can\u2019t always control what cookies this third party content sets. Tracking \"Do Not Track\" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services. We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site beyond our basic Google Analytics tracking, which you may opt out of here. Because we do not share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection on Onepanel for any of our users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an individual browser's Do Not Track setting. If you are interested in turning on your browser\u2019s privacy and Do Not Track settings, the Do Not Track website has browser-specific instructions. Please see our section on email communication to learn about our use of pixel tags in marketing emails. How Onepanel secures your information Onepanel takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Onepanel's global privacy practices Information that we collect will be stored and processed in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Statement. However, we understand that we have users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs. We provide the same standard of privacy protection to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide. We have appointed a Privacy Counsel and we work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business. Additionally, we require that if our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws, including signing data transfer agreements such as Standard Contractual Clause agreements. In particular: Onepanel provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data collection, when we do collect your personal data. We collect only the minimum amount of personal data necessary, unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing. We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the data we have collected. We provide our users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing. We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement. These are the Privacy Shield Principles, but they are also just good practices. Onepanel adheres to the Privacy Shield Framework. You may view our entry in the Privacy Shield List. In addition to providing our users methods of unambiguous, informed consent and control over their data, we participate in and comply with the Privacy Shield framework, and we are committed to subject any Personal Information we receive from the EU and EEA to the Privacy Shield Principles. In addition, we continue to participate in the Safe Harbor Framework for Swiss data transfers to the US. Please read more about Onepanel's Privacy Shield and Safe Harbor commitments. Resolving Complaints If you have concerns about the way Onepanel is handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help. You may contact us directly at info@Onepanel.io with the subject line \"Privacy Shield Concerns.\" We will respond within 45 days at the latest. Dispute Resolution Process In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and Onepanel regarding our handling of your User Personal Information, we will do our best to resolve it. If we cannot, we have selected JAMS, an independent dispute resolution provider, to handle unresolved Privacy Shield complaints. If we are unable to resolve your concerns after a good faith effort to address them, you may contact JAMS and submit a Privacy Shield claim. JAMS is a US-based private alternate dispute resolution provider, and we have contracted with JAMS to provide an independent recourse mechanism for any of our users for privacy concerns at no cost to you. You do not need to appear in court; you may conduct this dispute resolution process via telephone or video conference. If you are not based in the EU or EEA, but you would still like to use the JAMS arbitration process to resolve your dispute, please let us know and we will provide access to you. Independent Arbitration Under certain limited circumstances, European Union individuals may invoke binding Privacy Shield arbitration as a last resort if all other forms of dispute resolution have been unsuccessful. To learn more about this method of resolution and its availability to you, please read more about Privacy Shield. We are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission. How we respond to compelled disclosure Onepanel may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large. In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, Onepanel strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances. How you can access and control the information we collect If you're already a Onepanel user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by editing your user profile or contacting info@Onepanel.io Data Retention and Deletion Onepanel will retain User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion. For example, we don\u2019t automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain your account information indefinitely. If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in your user profile. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 30 days. How we communicate with you We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you\u2019ve said that\u2019s okay. You have a lot of control over how your email address is used and shared on and through Onepanel. You may manage your communication preferences in your user profile. If you would like your email to remain private, even when you\u2019re commenting on public repositories, you can create a private email address in your user profile. You can also update your local Onepanel configuration to use your private email address. This will not change how we contact you, but it will affect how others see you. Depending on your email settings, Onepanel may occasionally send notification emails about changes in a repository you\u2019re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or offer customer support. We also send marketing emails, but only with your consent. There's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the emails we send you. Our emails might contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we\u2019re not sending you unwanted email. If you prefer not to receive pixel tags, please opt out of marketing emails. Changes to our Privacy Statement Although most changes are likely to be minor, Onepanel may change our Privacy Statement from time to time. We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Statement through our Website at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page or sending email to the email address specified in your Onepanel primary account. For changes to this Privacy Statement that do not affect your rights, we encourage visitors to check this page frequently.

Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers a browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking. Certain pages on our site may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we can\u2019t always control what cookies this third party content sets. Tracking \"Do Not Track\" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services. We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site beyond our basic Google Analytics tracking, which you may opt out of here. Because we do not share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection on Onepanel for any of our users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an individual browser's Do Not Track setting. If you are interested in turning on your browser\u2019s privacy and Do Not Track settings, the Do Not Track website has browser-specific instructions.

How Onepanel secures your information Onepanel takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Onepanel's global privacy practices Information that we collect will be stored and processed in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Statement. However, we understand that we have users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs. We provide the same standard of privacy protection to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide. We have appointed a Privacy Counsel and we work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business. Additionally, we require that if our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws, including signing data transfer agreements such as Standard Contractual Clause agreements. In particular: Onepanel provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data collection, when we do collect your personal data. We collect only the minimum amount of personal data necessary, unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing. We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the data we have collected. We provide our users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing. We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement. These are the Privacy Shield Principles, but they are also just good practices. Onepanel adheres to the Privacy Shield Framework. You may view our entry in the Privacy Shield List. In addition to providing our users methods of unambiguous, informed consent and control over their data, we participate in and comply with the Privacy Shield framework, and we are committed to subject any Personal Information we receive from the EU and EEA to the Privacy Shield Principles. In addition, we continue to participate in the Safe Harbor Framework for Swiss data transfers to the US. Please read more about Onepanel's Privacy Shield and Safe Harbor commitments. Resolving Complaints If you have concerns about the way Onepanel is handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help. You may contact us directly at info@Onepanel.io with the subject line \"Privacy Shield Concerns.\" We will respond within 45 days at the latest. Dispute Resolution Process In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and Onepanel regarding our handling of your User Personal Information, we will do our best to resolve it. If we cannot, we have selected JAMS, an independent dispute resolution provider, to handle unresolved Privacy Shield complaints. If we are unable to resolve your concerns after a good faith effort to address them, you may contact JAMS and submit a Privacy Shield claim. JAMS is a US-based private alternate dispute resolution provider, and we have contracted with JAMS to provide an independent recourse mechanism for any of our users for privacy concerns at no cost to you. You do not need to appear in court; you may conduct this dispute resolution process via telephone or video conference. If you are not based in the EU or EEA, but you would still like to use the JAMS arbitration process to resolve your dispute, please let us know and we will provide access to you. Independent Arbitration Under certain limited circumstances, European Union individuals may invoke binding Privacy Shield arbitration as a last resort if all other forms of dispute resolution have been unsuccessful. To learn more about this method of resolution and its availability to you, please read more about Privacy Shield. We are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission. How we respond to compelled disclosure Onepanel may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large. In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, Onepanel strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances. How you can access and control the information we collect If you're already a Onepanel user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by editing your user profile or contacting info@Onepanel.io Data Retention and Deletion Onepanel will retain User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion. For example, we don\u2019t automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain your account information indefinitely. If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in your user profile. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 30 days. How we communicate with you We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you\u2019ve said that\u2019s okay. You have a lot of control over how your email address is used and shared on and through Onepanel. You may manage your communication preferences in your user profile. If you would like your email to remain private, even when you\u2019re commenting on public repositories, you can create a private email address in your user profile. You can also update your local Onepanel configuration to use your private email address. This will not change how we contact you, but it will affect how others see you. Depending on your email settings, Onepanel may occasionally send notification emails about changes in a repository you\u2019re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or offer customer support. We also send marketing emails, but only with your consent. There's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the emails we send you. Our emails might contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we\u2019re not sending you unwanted email. If you prefer not to receive pixel tags, please opt out of marketing emails. Changes to our Privacy Statement Although most changes are likely to be minor, Onepanel may change our Privacy Statement from time to time. We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Statement through our Website at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page or sending email to the email address specified in your Onepanel primary account. For changes to this Privacy Statement that do not affect your rights, we encourage visitors to check this page frequently.

The Code for the App is Hosted here . The whole project can be visualized in the block diagram below : Steps \u00b6 Resume dataset-upload-api and run video_upload.py to start the API . The basic idea of file uploads is actually quite simple. It basically works like this: A <form> tag is marked with enctype=multipart/form-data and an <input type=file> is placed in that form. The application accesses the file from the files dictionary on the request object. use the save() method of the file to save the file permanently somewhere on the filesystem. import os from flask import Flask , flash , request , redirect , url_for from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename UPLOAD_FOLDER = '/path/to/the/uploads' ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = { 'txt' , 'pdf' , 'png' , 'jpg' , 'jpeg' , 'gif' } app = Flask ( __name__ ) app . config [ 'UPLOAD_FOLDER' ] = UPLOAD_FOLDER The werkzeug.secure_filename() is explained a little bit later. The UPLOAD_FOLDER is where we will store the uploaded files and the ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS is the set of allowed file extensions. Next the functions that check if an extension is valid and that uploads the file and redirects the user to the URL for the uploaded file: def allowed_file ( filename ): return '.' in filename and \\ filename . rsplit ( '.' , 1 )[ 1 ] . lower () in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS @app . route ( '/' , methods = [ 'GET' , 'POST' ]) def upload_file (): if request . method == 'POST' : # check if the post request has the file part if 'file' not in request . files : flash ( 'No file part' ) return redirect ( request . url ) file = request . files [ 'file' ] # if user does not select file, browser also # submit an empty part without filename if file . filename == '' : flash ( 'No selected file' ) return redirect ( request . url ) if file and allowed_file ( file . filename ): filename = secure_filename ( file . filename ) file . save ( os . path . join ( app . config [ 'UPLOAD_FOLDER' ], filename )) return redirect ( url_for ( 'uploaded_file' , filename = filename )) return ''' <!doctype html> <title>Upload new File</title> <h1>Upload new File</h1> <form method=post enctype=multipart/form-data> <input type=file name=file> <input type=submit value=Upload> </form> ''' ``` Annotation \u00b6 Once Data is Upload is in the workspace, create a Datset and Pull it into CVAT Workspace and start Annotating. Dump the annotations into a CVAT XML . Given a CVAT XML and a directory with the image dataset, this script reads the CVAT XML and writes the annotations in tfrecords format into a given directory in addition to the label map required for the tensorflow object detection API. Install necessary packages (including tensorflow). sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3-pip python3-dev pip3 install -r requirements.txt 2. Install the tensorflow object detection API \u00b6 If it's already installed you can check your $PYTHONPATH and move on to the usage section. Here's a quick (unofficial) guide on how to do that. For more details follow the official guide INSTALL TENSORFLOW OBJECT DETECTION API . # clone the models repository git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git # install some dependencies pip3 install --user Cython pip3 install --user contextlib2 pip3 install --user pillow pip3 install --user lxml pip3 install --user jupyter pip3 install --user matplotlib # clone and compile the cocoapi git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git cd cocoapi/PythonAPI make cp -r pycocotools <path_to_models_repo>/models/research/ # Protobuf Compilation cd <path_to_models_repo>/models/research/ protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out = . # setup the PYTHONPATH export PYTHONPATH = $PYTHONPATH : ` pwd ` : ` pwd ` /slim ``` ## Usage Run the script. ``` bash $python3 converter.py --cvat-xml </path/to/cvat/xml> --image-dir </path/to/images> \\ --output-dir </path/to/output/directory> --attribute <attribute> Leave --attribute argument empty if you want the to consider CVAT labels as tfrecords labels, otherwise you can specify a used attribute name like --attribute <attribute> . Please run python converter.py --help for more details. Once Data is Annotated and Converted to tfrecords, use the Following to train a model using it $python /onepanel/code/models/research/object_detection/legacy/train.py \\ --train_dir = /onepanel/code/Custom-Mask-RCNN-using-Tensorfow-Object-detection-API/CP \\ --pipeline_config_path = /onepanel/code/Custom-Mask-RCNN-using-Tensorfow-Object-detection-API/mask_rcnn_inception_v2_coco.config Start the Inference API \u00b6 Once we\u2019ve retrained our model and exported it to disk, we can host the model as a service. We\u2019ll load the model from disk with a simple function that takes the graph definition directly from the file and uses that to generate a graph. TensorFlow does most of this for us, Resume dataset-upload-api and run video_upload.py to start the API . detection_graph = tf . Graph () with detection_graph . as_default (): od_graph_def = tf . GraphDef () with tf . gfile . GFile ( PATH_TO_CKPT , 'rb' ) as fid : serialized_graph = fid . read () od_graph_def .

After we\u2019ve created a Flask app object: app = Flask ( __name__ ) Then, we can easily create routes for where our classification service will live. Let\u2019s create a default route to our classify() function that will allow us to pass an image to the endpoint for identification. @app . route ( '/' ) def uploaded_file ( filename ): PATH_TO_TEST_IMAGES_DIR = app . config [ 'UPLOAD_FOLDER' ] TEST_IMAGE_PATHS = [ os . path . join ( PATH_TO_TEST_IMAGES_DIR , filename . format ( i )) for i in range ( 1 , 2 ) ] IMAGE_SIZE = ( 12 , 8 ) with detection_graph . as_default (): with tf . Session ( graph = detection_graph ) as sess : for image_path in TEST_IMAGE_PATHS : image = Image . open ( image_path ) image_np = load_image_into_numpy_array ( image ) image_np_expanded = np . expand_dims ( image_np , axis = 0 ) image_tensor = detection_graph . get_tensor_by_name ( 'image_tensor:0' ) boxes = detection_graph . get_tensor_by_name ( 'detection_boxes:0' ) scores = detection_graph . get_tensor_by_name ( 'detection_scores:0' ) classes = detection_graph . get_tensor_by_name ( 'detection_classes:0' ) num_detections = detection_graph . get_tensor_by_name ( 'num_detections:0' ) ( boxes , scores , classes , num_detections ) = sess . run ( [ boxes , scores , classes , num_detections ], feed_dict = { image_tensor : image_np_expanded }) vis_util . visualize_boxes_and_labels_on_image_array ( image_np , np . squeeze ( boxes ), np . squeeze ( classes ) . astype ( np . int32 ), np . squeeze ( scores ), category_index , use_normalized_coordinates = True , line_thickness = 8 ) im = Image . fromarray ( image_np ) im . save ( 'uploads/' + filename ) return send_from_directory ( app . config [ 'UPLOAD_FOLDER' ], filename ) Using the decorator syntax to define the route, it will configure the service so that our uploaded_file() function will be called every time someone hits the root of our service address. We said we wanted users to be able to specify a file to be identified so we\u2019ll store that as a parameter from the request: file_name = request . args [ 'file' ] `` In an actual app , we \u2019 d probably populate this from a form attachment or URL . For our example , we \u2019 ll simply let users specify a path to the file that they want to be identified . We can then read the image file and turn it into a tensor to be used as input to the graph we loaded previously . The base script included a number of useful functions including read_tensor_from_image_file () which will take the image file and turn it into a tensor to use as input by using a small custom TensorFlow graph . Running the inference on our graph with this image is again quite straightforward : ``` python ( boxes , scores , classes , num_detections ) = sess . run ( [ boxes , scores , classes , num_detections ], feed_dict = { image_tensor : image_np_expanded }) ``` In this line , the variable t represents the image tensor that was created by read_tensor_from_image_file () function . TensorFlow will then take that image and run the new retrained model to generate predictions . Those predictions come as a series of probabilities that indicate which of the classes ( poodle , pug , or wiener dog ) is the most likely . Since this is just a prediction service , it will simply return a JSON representation of the arrays . Inside our script we can start our service with : ``` python app . run ( debug = True , port = 5000 ) Then, if we want to launch the script from the command line, all we have to do is run python app.py and it will initialize and start running on port 5000. Using the Service \u00b6 We can now use this service either by visiting it in a web browser or generally making any REST call on that port. For an easy test we can access it using following code snippet: import os import requests url = 'http://0.0.0.0:5000/onepanel-demo/projects/mobile-demo/workspaces/classification/api/upload' path_img = '/onepanel/code/FlaskObjectDetection/centaur_2.mpg' with open ( path_img , 'rb' ) as img : name_img = os . path . basename ( path_img ) files = { 'file' : ( name_img , img , 'multipart/form-data' ,{ 'Expires' : '0' }) } with requests .

We're happy you're here. Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before accessing or using Onepanel. Because it is such an important contract between us and our users, we have tried to make it as clear as possible.. Effective date: May 24, 2018 A. Definitions The \u201cAgreement\u201d refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the \u201cTerms of Service\u201d or the \"Terms\") and all other operating rules, policies (including the Onepanel Privacy Statement, available at Onepanel.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. The \u201cService\u201d refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Onepanel. The \u201cWebsite\u201d refers to Onepanel\u2019s website located at Onepanel.io and all content, services, and products provided by Onepanel at or through the Website. It also refers to Onepanel-owned subdomains of Onepanel.io. Occasionally, websites owned by Onepanel may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service. \u201cThe User,\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d and \u201cYour\u201d refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts. \u201cOnepanel,\u201d \u201cWe,\u201d and \u201cUs\u201d refer to Onepanel, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees. \u201cContent\u201d refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. \"Content\" also includes Services. \u201cUser-Generated Content\u201d is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. \"Your Content\" is Content that you create or own. B. Account Terms 1. Required Information You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes. Account Requirements We have a few simple rules for accounts on Onepanel's Service. You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by \"bots\" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts: A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account. One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine). You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. Onepanel does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User\u2019s account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country\u2019s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country\u2019s laws. Your login may only be used by one person \u2014 i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization account may create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows. Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you've ordered from us. 3. User Account Security You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your account's security, but the content of your account and its security are up to you. You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is posted by others who have accounts under your account). You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Onepanel cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. You will promptly notify Onepanel if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account. 4. Additional Terms In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of Onepanel. For example, you may be a member of an organization on Onepanel with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with Onepanel; or you may use Onepanel to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you. C. Acceptable Use 1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations. Content Restrictions You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that: is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities; is or contains sexually obscene content; is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent; is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group; contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights. 3. Conduct Restrictions While using Onepanel, you agree that you will not under any circumstances: harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including Onepanel employees, officers, and agents, or other Onepanel Users; use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes; attempt to disrupt or tamper with Onepanel's servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on Onepanel's servers through automated means, or to access Onepanel's Service in ways that exceed your authorization; impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with Onepanel, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent. 4. Services Usage Limits You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without Onepanel's express written permission. Scraping Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through Onepanel's API. You may not scrape Onepanel for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Onepanel users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. Privacy Misuse of Onepanel Users' Personal Information is prohibited. Any person, entity, or service collecting data from Onepanel must comply with the Onepanel Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the Onepanel Privacy Statement). If you collect any Onepanel User's Personal Information from Onepanel, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from Onepanel, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from Onepanel or Onepanel Users. Excessive Bandwidth Use If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other Onepanel customers, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption. User Protection You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole. D. User-Generated Content 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content. Onepanel May Remove Content We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any Onepanel terms or policies. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create or own (\"Your Content\"). If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post. Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us \u2014 and other Onepanel Users \u2014 certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 \u2014 D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Onepanel the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required.
